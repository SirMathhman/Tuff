# Self Copy Sample

Simple Node.js script that copies itself to a new file.

Usage:

```bash
bun ./self_copy.ts
```

By default, the script writes a consistently-named copy: `copy_of_self_copy.ts`. The script does not accept command-line arguments and is intended to be run with bun.

Run tests:

```bash
npm test
```
