# Tuff

A small TypeScript interpreter/evaluator used for experimenting with expressions, sized integer suffixes, blocks, assignments, if/else, match/case, functions/closures, and while-loops (with break/continue).

## Development

- Run tests: `pnpm test`
- Run lint: `pnpm lint`

The test suite is written with Vitest and lives under `test/`.
